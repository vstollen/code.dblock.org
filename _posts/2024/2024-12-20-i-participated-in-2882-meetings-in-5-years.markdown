Since my first day in AWS 5 1/2 years ago, Iâ€™ve been experimenting with keeping a CHANGELOG of everything I do, available for everyone at the company to see. I wrote about it [here](/2020/09/01/keep-a-changelog-at-work.html). If you work at AWS, use the URL in the screenshot below to find it.

I wrote a little script to try and classify where I spent my time. Here are some quick, very unscientific results.

I participated in **2882 meetings**, 75% were probably technical discussions and 25% were not, including business reviews. I made **1013** code contributions, reviewed or read **364** documents, mostly technical designs. I did **192 1:1s** with my colleagues, **130** interviews, and helped with **80 promos**. I debugged or otherwise dealt with **175 customer-facing issues**, authored **78 documents**, took **64 trainings**, and engaged in **48** planning exercises.

This, of course, doesn't tell you anything useful. If you actually want to learn more about what PEs do at Amazon, check out the excellent [Principal Engineer Roles Framework](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/principal-engineer-roles-framework-mai-lan-tomsen-bukovec-142df/) that I have been using since 2019 and that was made public this week by Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec.
